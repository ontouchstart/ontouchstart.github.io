I start to write something on my phone. You can call it a blog, a page, a scroll or whatever. I wish I can load a roll of paper and start to type like Jack Kerouac. 

Anyway. I stop here on Flight AA1936 to Chicago.

Evanston, IL

Reading stories about Alan Turing, Kurt Gödel and Princeton. Thinking about the "usefulness of useless knowledge", medical schools and mathematic, M.D and Ph.D., money and material world v.s. the world of the mind: ideas, concepts, theories.

What is the context of this picture? How might it change in the future?
Would LLM help or would it just give bullshit word salad based on whatever data it was trained on?

Did a barefoot trail walk in Ramapo. Thinking about formal logic vs informal logic. 科學 vs 玄學. Physics vs Metaphysics. (This Meta is not that Meta). 道可道非常道, 名可名非常名.

🦶2025 Bronx 10 Mile+ 🦶

I have run Bronx 10 Mile race officially three times (2021, 2022, 2023). It is my favorite course. Today I ran from Fort Lee across GW Bridge, Washington Hights, Harlem, High Bridge, Yankee Stadium and joined the race unofficially, then ran back to Fort Lee to cover 20.25 miles (number game is fun.)
