Read about Gödel, Turing and Church in several fascinating books.

- Stephen Budiansky. _JOURNEY to the EDGE of REASON: The Life of Kurt Gödel_
- Rebecca Goldstein. _Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Gödel_
- David Leavitt. _The Man Who Knew Too Much: Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer_
