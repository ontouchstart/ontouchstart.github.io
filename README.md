Ladder of abstraction: 
- Philosophy (most useless?)
- Mathematics
- Physics
- Engineering (most useful?)

Read about Gödel and  Turing in three fascinating books.

- Stephen Budiansky. _JOURNEY to the EDGE of REASON: The Life of Kurt Gödel_
- Rebecca Goldstein. _Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Gödel_
- David Leavitt. _The Man Who Knew Too Much: Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer_

Day job: finally wrapped up a feature with good performance. Need to add more test coverage and make a clean package. Didn't write a single line of code by hand. Feel like a professor advises a group of LLM graduate students. (The future is here.)

Hobby: continue to read Turing. He is also a long distance runner. This feels like trail running. 

> For Turing the 1940s was an era defined more by beginnings than by culminations. Ideas would come to him, he would throw himself into them, and then, before he had brought them to fruition, he would drift away, either because circumstances compelled him to or because some other idea had seized his attention.

(Birthday) Hobby: Reading Turing on Kindle Scribe.

"American tradition of solving one's difficulties by means of much equipment rather than thought."
